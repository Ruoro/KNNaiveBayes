# KNNaiveBayes
Data Science Core Independent Project Week 9
## Classification of Titanic & Email Datasets
## Description
Experimenting using the K-NN and Naive Bayes Classifiers on two different datasets in order to observe their performance. Firstly, the Titanic dataset was used to test the K-NN classifier then Naive Bayes classifier was used on a text vectorized dataset to classify emails as either ham or spam.

## Platforms Used
-Google Colab
-Git/GitHub
-Technologies Used
-Python
-Pandas Library
-Numpy Library
-Matplotlib Library

The goal was to observe the performance of the two types of classifiers (K-NN & Naive Bayes) after determining the optimum train/test split, hyperparameters and utilizing model performance enhancements(data reduction, scaling, applying smoothing or not, etc).
